# 202020
This is an application I made in Godot 4 to remind me to practice the 20 20 20 rule. If you don't know what that is, it's where every 20 minutes you look at something 20 feet way for 20 secounds to reduce eye strain from looking at somthing up close like a computer screen. Feel free to use it/modify it to your needs.
